AWS
Containers
• Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) • Amazon’ s own container platform
• Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) • Amazon’ s managed Kubernetes
(open source) • AWS Far gate • Amazon’ s own Serverless container platform • Wor ks
with ECS and with EKS • Amazon ECR: • Store container images
Highlighted: EC2 Launch Type: you must provision & maintain the infrastructure (the
EC2 instances | Comment Text: what's dif ference betwenn ECS launch type vs far gate?
Each EC2 Instance must run the ECS Agent to register in the ECS Cluste
Highlighted: EC2 Instance Profile (EC2 Launch Type only): • Used by the ECS agent •
Makes API calls to ECS service • Send container logs to CloudW atch Logs • Pull Docker
image from ECR • Reference sensitive data in Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Stor |
Comment Text: how does ec2 instance launch type pulls ecs
Highlighted: Allows each task to have a specific role • Use dif ferent roles for the
different ECS Services you run • Ta s k R o l e i s d e f i n e d i n t h e task definition |
Comment Text: can you run dif ferent roles for each ecs far gate task?
Highlighted: Mount EFS file systems onto ECS tasks • Wor ks for both EC2 and Far gate
launch types • Ta s k s r u n n i n g i n a n y A Z w i l l s h a r e t h e same data in the EFS
file system • Far gate + EFS = Serverless | Comment Text: How can data volume work
with ecs
Highlighted: Ta r g e t Tr a c k i n g – scale based on tar get value for a specific
CloudW atch metric • Step Scaling – scale based on a specified CloudW atch Alarm •
Scheduled Scaling – scale based on a specified date/time (predictable changes) |
Comment Text: Type of ecs scaling schemes
Highlighted: Auto Scaling Group Scaling • Scale your ASG based on CPU Utilization •
Add EC2 instances over time • ECS Cluster Capacity Provider • Used to automatically
provision and scale the infrastructure for your ECS Tasks • Capacity Provider paired
with an Auto Scaling Group • Add EC2 Instances when you’re missing capacity (CPU,
RAM...) | Comment Text: Types of autoscaling scheme for ecsPage 4

Highlighted: Private and Public repository (Amazon ECR Public Gallery
https://gallery .ecr.aws) • Fully integrated with ECS, backed by Amazon S3 • Access is
controlled through IAM (permission errors => policy) • Supports image vulnerability
scanning, versioning, image tags, image lifecycle, . | Comment Text: Features of ECR
Highlighted: Kubernetes is an open-source system for automatic deployment, scaling
and management of containerized (usually Docker) application • It’ s an alternative to
ECS, similar goal but dif ferent API | Comment Text: what's kubernetes?
Highlighted: Managed Node Groups • Creates and manages Nodes (EC2 instances) for
you • Nodes are part of an ASG managed by EKS • Supports On-Demand or Spot
Instances • Self-Managed Nodes • Nodes created by you and registered to the EKS
cluster and managed by an ASG • Yo u c a n u s e p r e b u i l t A M I - Amazon EKS
Optimized AMI • Supports On-Demand or Spot Instances • AWS Far gate • No
maintenance required; no nodes managed | Comment Text: Types of nodes for amazon
eks

Container Storage Interface (CSI) compliant driver | Comment Text: how to setup data
volumes for Amazon EKS
Highlighted: Amazon EBS • Amazon EFS (works with Far gate) • Amazon FSx for
Lustre • Amazon FSx for NetApp ONT AP | Comment Text: data volumes supported by
amazon eks
Highlighted: Fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy web applications and
APIs at scale • No infrastructure experience required • Start with your source code or
container image • Automatically builds and deploy the web app • Automatic scaling,
highly available, load balancer , encr yption • VPC access support • Connect to database,
cache, and message queue services • Use cases: web apps, APIs, microservices, rapid
production deployment | Comment Text: what's aws app runner?
Highlighted: CLI tool for migrating and modernizing Java and .NET  web apps into
Docker Containers • Lift-and-shift your apps running in on-premises bare metal, virtual
machines, or in any Cloud to AWS • Accelerate modernization, no code changes, migrate
legacy apps... • Generates CloudFormation templates (compute, network...) • Register
generated Docker containers to ECR • Deploy to ECS, EKS, or App Runner • Supports
pre-built CI/CD pipelines | Comment Text: what's app2containerPage 440
